# Linux Zero to Hero — Introduction (Slides)

## Goal
Get learners oriented quickly: what to expect and the recommended learning path.

## Learning outcomes
- Open a terminal and run basic commands
- Understand filesystem layout and permissions
- Use common commands for files, processes, and networking
- Complete hands-on labs in the `labs/` folder

## Recommended path
1. `installation/` — set up your environment
2. `linux-basics/` — read core concepts
3. `linux-commands/` — practice command-by-command
4. `practice/` and `scenarios/` — apply knowledge to real problems

## Slide notes / presenter prompts
- Emphasize hands-on practice: encourage learners to run commands as you demo.
- Keep explanations short and show one command at a time.
- Use the `labs/` Docker environment to demonstrate real outputs safely.
